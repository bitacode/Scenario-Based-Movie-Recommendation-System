                "Review": "This spaghetti western by way of Indonesia is a beautiful third feature by Mouly Surya. This film proves she's a strong voice in world cinema with a flare for visually stunning widescreen imagery. Premiered at Directors Fortnight at Cannes and has had a great fest run. KimStim released it in the States. KimStim is really aquiring some fantastic titles. The first full-length film from Indonesia to be appeared in Cannes Film Festival in the last 12 years.Watched on vimeo link."

                "Review": "Somehow achieves the extraordinarily difficult task of being a contemplative fusion of interior visual compositions and static landscape photography, all flawlessly framed with a fucking marvelous musical backdrop -- ingredients of the almost ambient naturalism commonly attributed to the kind of imagistic films that many consider to be of the purely \"art\" sort, a notion which I strongly oppose -- all the while remaining more engrossing and compelling on a level of interpersonal tension/unease than the majority of (the more overt and noisy) genre films I've seen as of late."

Also, it's not as visually dark and depressing as one might expect from such material but rather glary.It's definitely a mood-piece because the film relies heavily on its images along Marlina's journey and is therein definitely akin to the western genre, which also applies to the plot, which is pretty straightforward and without too many twists or turns.

The reality of these lives is frankly and cruelly denied by men (husbands; lovers; brothers; fathers) to whom stories are offered and so, by necessity, they're hidden away.Trauma and rage hidden behind blank, emotionalness walls. Behind acquiescence and silence. Behind swallowed-down protests, and countless bitten-off retorts."

While my understanding of Indonesian cinema has been extremely lacking so far unfortunately, the sexual politics and repercussions of a male-dominated society that looks down upon women as objects or properties are universally applicable."

Marlina The Murderer In Four Acts is an Indonesian tale of neo-western vengeance and rape-revenge justice filtered through a feminist lens. The most tensely nonchalant home invasion ever, a patriarchal intrusion dispassionately promising pillage and gang assault upon a vulnerable widow, soon becomes the start of a righteous saga."

The film has its moments and the fact a story about female empowerment is filmed stylistically in the backdrop of the Western, typically perceived as masculine, is both bold and refreshing and I‚Äôd recommend the film for that alone. Having said that, the final act felt completely flat and undid a lot of the good stuff leading up to the climatic showdown."

Starting from the view of Sumba that is very pleasing to the eye, to the story that is built super solidly. Although the premise of this film is quite simple, it takes a high level of reasoning to understand the whole film. Not only playing with symbols and metaphors, but the staging in a scene also \"conveys\" the meaning. One of the most memorable films. It's a must-watch!"

This film tells the story of brave women who are steadfast in facing the cruelty of life, and also clearly touches on the negligence of the authorities in carrying out their duties. It doesn't take much dialogue to describe the simple life and complicated situation in the area. Although I expected more from the delivery of the story and the ending, the film is interesting enough to watch."

This film presents a simple premise with minimal dialogue, but I salute the way it packs strong emotions. Marlina is depressed and burdened, has no physical power, but with her intelligence she can conquer a group of bad-ass men. The issue of sexual violence and crime is the main topic. Not only that, the beauty of Sumba is pleasing to the eye, the landscape shooting technique also makes it comfortable to watch, and the minimalist scoring is really good."

The story itself is also really related to the situation in Indonesia, a good script also makes this film even more fun. This film also takes several long take shots but not too long, enough to add its own points because it is combined with beautiful cinematography. The music scoring here is also really helpful. Because this scoring really makes it tense and exciting to hear. If this film was made more bloody, maybe I would like it more. But this has also succeeded in captivating me. Recommended."

There are too many issues that want to be included in the movie and the transition from one issue to another I think is too fast so that the audience is not given enough time to understand the plot. I also feel that there are some dialogues that are quite long-winded and complicated in conveying the story point. The twist also feels very sudden. Maybe the intention was to make a twist that shows don't tell but in my opinion it feels very odd"

As big as the first bazooka explosion. The opening scene is quite grand. A group of people sabotage traffic and then attack a truck filled with money. Like Robin Hood, the group of anarchists did not steal a single penny of the money."

The emotions that were also built in the first half slowly fade, leaving the journey to the conclusion of the film in free fall. Even though in terms of music scoring, it is very supportive as an action-thriller film. Logical fallacies are also scattered everywhere."

It is very obvious that this film is ambitious, going all out and maximizing the budget for the visuals, action sequences, cinematography, and scoring. The result? Not disappointing, including quite good for an Indonesian film. The action scenes are quite good, although sometimes the choreography of the action scenes looks a bit less flexible. The CGI of the bomb explosions is quite okay although still a bit rough. The scoring sounds grand and intense. However, the bomb explosions shown are not as many as the title of the film"

The preaching delivered is quite good and the moral message is very understandable. Suitable as a reminder for us of the sins that have been committed from bad deeds. Every good and bad deed in the world will definitely be accounted for in the afterlife. From here we understand that no matter how small a bad deed is, it will still get terrible punishment in Hell."

Have you seen the torture in hell that was seen in the trailer? YES THAT'S JUST THE TORTURE, the thing I was worried about from the first release of the teaser turned out to be the case"

This film is indeed a torture for approximately 90 minutes. It started quite promisingly but finally just rolled without any interesting Plot and characters. Let's think positively, maybe the original source of this Hell Torture is indeed selling lectures and scary torture descriptions so that all parties involved have no power to make something more. For me the film is just flat and boring."

This film, which delves deeply into religious themes and the concept of hell, had moments that were thought-provoking but ultimately fell short in several areas. First, let's talk about the religious context. It attempts to depict the torments of hell as described in various religious texts, primarily drawing from Islamic teachings. The film's depiction of the afterlife's punitive aspects is intense and graphic, aiming to evoke a sense of fear"

It is exactly the same scene where the tongue is cut off and grows back, the body is plunged into lava fire and then becomes whole again.

Noer and the legendary Salman Aristo, no wonder! The technique is very mature, there are one or two misses but that's okay. The production design is really appreciated for the set and props. The cinematography is a mess because the dp ics are really annoying. This is really crazy, a light film that can be said to be complete in all aspects. Rise of Indonesian films (from just the horror genre)!"

Some good laughs, but basically that's it."

Surprisingly, they are not the only strength of this film. There is also Dea Panendra who steals the attention every time her character appears. This film at the beginning seems rushed but fortunately at the end it becomes clear where it is going and it becomes more exciting and warm at the same time. If only they were patient in introducing Mel and Satya, maybe the other characters too, maybe it would be more explosive at the end."

Mohon Doa Restu by Ody Harahap is a film that is suitable for family viewing with its funny comedy because of the behavior of Sarah Sechan and Cut Mini who play the parents of Jefri Nichol and Syifa Hadju. Mohon Doa Restu tells the story of Mel (Syifa Hadju) and Satya (Jefri Nichol) who used to be best friends since childhood but were separated because of distance, but the two met again and were finally matched by their respective parents."

The dynamics of family relationship conflict are really good, the characterization of the control freak mother duo is also really good. I don't know what this film would be without the great performances of Cut Mini, Sarah Sechan, and Dea Panendra. Unfortunately the drama is not very good, even there's a scene that tries to give the emotional side of this film but is covered by the chaotic comedy. The premise is simple but gives a serious and deep message. Light and fun."

So it is no wonder that Mohon Doa Restu is proof that he is an expert in bringing laughter. The script by Yayu Yuliani and Cassandra P. Cameron is like a machine that is slow to warm up. Their efforts to expand the perspective on ego and clashing principles must go through repetitive plots and packaging. Quite cramped, but slowly comfortable to follow which is also supported by the director's direction by maintaining his rhythm even though chaos reigns. For the acting department, they all complement each other, balancing each other when laughter or emotion is needed."

It seems like it's been a really long time, almost the last few years, there hasn't been a good Indonesian romcom.

It's no less hilarious than Ody's film New Rich People. The conflict in this film turns out to be multi-layered, but there's something that hasn't been resolved, namely the conflict between Brasko and his assistant, there's no resolution, instead Mel just accepts it and goes back to it. The middle to the final round felt breathless and dry. The drama of Mel's mother and father is deeper than Mel's own drama."

Continuing from Gita Cinta Dari SMA, Puspa Indah Taman Hati puts something special in its presentation, especially its songs that make you feel at home. The moment Ratna meets Marlina also feels relieved because everything is clear. Marlina's life is also similar to Ratna's, but her parents are more accepting. Prilly is cool, playing almost three different characters. Unfortunately, there is no scene stealer like Mbak Ayu in Gita Cinta. Pak Arga has a lot of potential because his story is interesting to develop."

Puspa Indah Taman Hati feels empty in the beginning to the middle of the film, besides being filled with songs and the introduction of the main character that is too long, the supporting characters that appear at the beginning of the act and take up quite a lot of frames do not give any impact at all to the climax and the fate of the main character himself. The wardrobe is too colorful and looks new, maybe the intention is to emphasize the time setting without writing the year."

Luckily the soundtracks here are getting bigger and more fun. Yes, even though Marlina's friends and parents weren't that hooked, their chemistry with the audience at the end of the sequel also felt like I thought Galih was a neutral evil type villain here, it's no longer Ratna's father whose fierceness is used as meta comedy dialogue here. heheh But seeing the moment when Prilly talks to her doppleganger is really unique in a film like this hahah"

Puspa Indah Taman Hati tastes too flat. It's different from the original Puspa Indah Taman Hati version, the plot is tighter, the chemistry between Marlina and Galih is also good, in the end it supports Galih moving on from Ratna and I'm also disappointed with the ending. If this seems rushed, especially since Ratna-Marlina's characters don't look that different. Yessi Gusman plays Marlina-Ratna, there really is no medicine, it's irreplaceable!"

The character development is more mature and the perspective given is also fair to each character. Then the use of Indonesian here is more relaxed even though we use standard language.

Galih's career achievements also seem like he wants to prove it to rich people because of the trauma of being humiliated by Ratna's father. So, whatever Galih said to Marlina, it didn't feel sincere to me. Prilly's acting is really cool here, especially when she says goodbye to Galih's mother."

There are one or two things that I hope are handled a little more neatly, such as the characters of Pak Arga, Aswin and Awang who could have been spices for additional conflict but were not maximized. Still can't compete with Gita Cinta from SMA for me, but this film is still a very enjoyable watch."

Playing with smart scene transitions, the dialogues are connected even though they are in different scenes.

Actually, there is a main problem that is built slowly, until finally at the peak it is revealed that this is an internal conflict between the members (his men). A life for a life. Unfortunately, the ending looks so-so. Kang Mus (Epy Kusnandar) as the boss looks regretful but he let it happen from the start. It's awkward."

Overall, the story has minimal meaning, almost the same as the series. the tv. The way the story is cut between one scene and another also makes this film funny, especially the characters of Mr. UU and Pipit.

In its unique storytelling, it uses many scenes into one continuous scene, like the opening scene \"The Same Is a Lie\". At first I was amazed, but it turned out to be used continuously throughout the film, sometimes it was a bit annoying. But I understand why you use it like that, because if you separate it, it will be difficult to put together a story with so many characters and it will feel too soap opera. So in this way, the soap opera impression is still there but not using the soap opera method."

However, with a 'magical' narrative, this film becomes interesting. The comedy is so innocent, but the drama is quite strong. The performances of the players are also fitting. Even Epy Kusnandar plays simply, as he is, which makes him have an equally strong role with the other players. And this is probably the strongest ensemble cast I have ever seen in an Indonesian film. Honestly, I am not a TV series viewer. I have only watched 1-2 episodes. But from there the characteristics of the \"Preman Pensiun\" series are very visible.

Yes, in soap operas, it got a very large TV rating, it is possible that people will see Mr. Mus, Miss Kinanti, Pipit, etc. and go to the cinema to watch them. The story that was adapted is more like continuing the soap opera. The characters that almost all of us know play their roles well. Only Sadana Agung seems to be less epic as Kang Mus's future son-in-law."

But like the work of \"Joko Anwar\" that we know, \"Gundala\" is still very worthy of watching, especially since the director maximizes the epic background and music. The use of a horror film-style background in some parts is so good, the surprise of the character's presence is also fun and the jokes that lighten the atmosphere that feels exciting. The players also play well, a not bad opening. Exceeds Expectations three point five out of five"

Sadly, the only thing we can do by the time being, is reflecting."

Confused about how far the General's house is from Agus's house or not? If you're far away, how come you can announce condolences from the mosque in the General's house? If it's close, why do you feel so far away when you're traveling by car?

What's interesting about Autobiography is that none of the people in this film are good, all are manipulative.

Quite successful, indeed, thanks to Makbul Mubarak's skill in constructing the story slowly and subtly, as well as how he arranges the scenes through 'clever' decisions. The acting of the two main characters is brilliantly played by Kevin Ardilova and‚Äîof course‚ÄîArswendy Nasution. On the other hand, this film's attempt to become a 'metanarrative' of the relations of power, politics, and the cruelty of the regime and other things that reside in the social constellation of society"

Mubarak's Autobiography is a slow burn that takes its time in contextualizing events w.r.t. history of the country and embracing the show-don't-tell approach for depicting the story. Its a crime thriller that demands us to come down at its wavelength w.r.t. pacing, with a sense of dread lingering throughout its runtime. The dreadfulness was intentionally unpleasant at times. Even though it didn't make international shortlist but it's still a damn fine movie (personally would've preferred it over Amerikatsi).2023 International Submissions Ranked 2023 Ranked"

A film that from the beginning to the end managed to make me think 'damn, is this an Indonesian film?'"

The mediocre CGI, editing and storytelling that are still far from perfect, the film starring Kevin Julion, Marthino Lio, Bisma Karisma and Omara Esteghal actually maximizes the characterization and chemistry built by the players. So, even though the limitations of CGI make the ending anticlimactic, the takeoff moment of the '1947 Cadets' accompanied by the song 'Bakti' by Anneth successfully provides an emotional impact."

There are not as many fighting and dogfight scenes as Sang Kiai. The film is not as colossal as Soegija. These expensive films are not Indonesian tastes. So it's rarely produced anymore. Sigit, played by Bisma Karisma, ex-boy band Smash, whose acting is no less than Iqbaal, who is also ex-boyband. It's just that Bisma doesn't have many opportunities. That's cool, cadet.

The story itself is very interesting as the first air attack carried out by the Republic of Indonesia. If the visual effects during the air battle, well, it's understandable. But the rest is very well made and it shows how big the budget of this film is. The story of the cadets is also quite interesting and there is always an element of betrayal typical of war films in general. But unfortunately because there are too many characters, the focus of the story is somewhat divided."

But unfortunately, the presentation is lacking, some moments that should be thunderous and emotional are not really felt, even almost boring.

It's true that the air war scene still looks unimpressive, especially in the ending, which is the minus of this film."

I think this film can be appreciated to maximize the script and save the absence of the scene. Replacing dogfights with romance spice may seem forced due to circumstances, but I think it's better than nothing. Even though the aerial scene we expected was not there, this film is still on the air!"

Unfortunately, Bisma Karisma is not capable as the main character, such as not getting along with other actors even with Givina as a love interest. The same thing was also done by Kevin Julio. Hardi Fadhillah gave the best impression since he first appeared. While Marthino Lio and Omara Esteghlal really carry the acting department."

It seems like the important thing is that the plot stays on the road by slipping all the characters. The existence of Bisma with his romance story is very disturbing. Chicco Kurniawan became redundant because he didn't get a lot of dialogue, fortunately Marthino Lio and Kevin Julio did not disappoint. The long-awaited attack scene turned out to be just a funny scene on the plane while being hit by a breeze. Meh. Yes, but it must still be appreciated because we have made a struggle film like this. After watching this, I also became a little curious about the history of the Indonesian Air Force."

The storm that was initially triggered by their first date in Kwitang failed because Cinta only remembered that she had made an appointment with a gang to watch the PAS band at school."

But they don't walk together as a couple, that's what makes my heart so sad and broken."

What's up with love is indeed a pop culture phenomenon in the millennial generation that has continued for dozens of years always living with generation after generation starting from the style of the characters, dialogue (jargon), to the songs. The package of what's up with love has been idolized year after year until now. The story of Rangga-Cinta ends sweetly and clearly. It really doesn't need a continuation."

The first 15 minutes may be the weakness of this film, the dialogue and acting are stiff, maybe the writer was confused about where to place the formal and non-formal dialogue. But far from that, the script is neat and complex, and the atmosphere is what I like the most. If you describe the atmosphere, I feel like I'm getting into this film, I don't know why, maybe I like the mood like heavy rain, fairy flies, and what's worse, the scoring is supportive. If you compare the first one, I like both."

Life's problems are getting more real & that's... annoying. Rangga's poems lose their \"male\" element & Melly's songs are not as beautiful as the first one.

And all of that is proven in what's up with love 2, I never hated Rangga at all, because I know he really sincerely loves Cinta in any situation. But for 9 years it's really long. It's really evil.

Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza are very aware that they want to present the film what's up with love 2 to the audience of what's up with love 1. Consistent and almost unchanging music and almost the same main cast are the markers. In my opinion, what's up with love is the song \"Bimbang\". The song is a strong identity of what's up with love. The audience of what's up with love 1 will not be able to escape from old memories when they hear the intro of the song \"Bimbang\"."

I like everything in the film starting from the story which is so good and neat, the plot is relaxed and not rushed , the cinematography is quite beautiful, and the background atmosphere is accompanied by music scoring that fits the atmosphere. The acting of the cast is also good, not bad. So it's not surprising that this film won the Citra Cup award as the best film."

You don't need a lot of dialogue, just good scoring and cool shooting, the story in this film can be conveyed very well. What I like the most here is the development of Alisha's character. Starting with a gloomy past, being restrained by his father, until finally he fell in love and was willing to do various things neatly arranged step by step. This means that his psychopathic behavior does not develop without a cause. Every incident must have a purpose."

The story is about a strange girl, a bit of a psychopath, who comes from a broken home, a father who is rarely at home, and is haunted by her mother who died by suicide. It is clear that Alisha/Mia's mental condition is worrying. And proven. Her attraction to a man (who appeared at her house for part-time work cleaning swimming pools), became an obsession that made her follow him and live in the unit next to him in a flat. That was only the beginning and background. Next, the story gets darker, and Mia's madness becomes more visible. In terms of story and cinematography, it's really good."

When Alisha/Mia speaks calmly, when she plays the cello, it feels so peaceful to listen to her, but when she's having a relapse... Oh my God. Mr. Bambang Saik really smoked cigars in Block S. He said he had intelligence, but he was weak when he was given a box of cigars and just believed Alisha, who had disappeared before."

I don't know, but this film could be considered an epic. I heard that people rated Tjoet Nja' Dhien very well, but after watching it I realized that even by today's Indonesian film standards, its superiority has not been shaken. I was fascinated by the narration and the opening scene. Slamet Rahardjo plays a dominant role as Teuku Umar, but none of them are as influential as Christine Hakim, who is charismatic and also fragile but doesn't forget to humanize herself."

A persistent effort to defend sovereignty is displayed so cruelly and cunningly, but also full of hope and confidence. War does not benefit anyone in the end, but with this path alone an invader can leave his feet from the land we uphold. Tjoet Nja Dhien still has its own shortcomings from the loose pacing of the wars and regional politics of Aceh at that time, but this film still succeeds in making us ask what the meaning of struggle is and what the faith we hold is for the common good of humanity."

The large number of extra soldiers during the war scenes really makes the scale of the war even more pronounced, it feels like the Japanese samurai film Ran which was also released in the 80s.

There is not much dialogue, but the message and story are conveyed well through the actors' expressions and neat cinematography. It was as if Raihaanun and Lukman Sardi's eyes were talking to the audience. The soft piano music also sharpens and emphasizes the pain. While watching, for some reason I often felt tight in my chest, maybe I was too carried away by my emotions. A big mistake watching in the middle of the (quiet) night. Apart from the technical things that are definitely lacking, in my opinion this is a film that is very worthy of being recommended."

The writer said that this film had to be written in a believable way and the character development had to feel real and progressive, so May's choice didn't feel sudden.

But, apart from that, I like May's story which is presented in silence, we are still able to understand the pain and depression she is experiencing, Raihaanun managed to portray her character very well even though it was only through gestures and eyes. The father's persistence in healing his beloved child was also played skillfully by Lukman Sardi. This film provides a perspective from the perspective of a victim of sexual harassment, where every step feels heavy and full of emotional turmoil."

Even though you could say that this film has a very slow pace, it should be a film that you have to watch, even if only once in your life. With the clear conflict at the beginning, it makes us curious, even though it is really very slow, as if we were reading a story before bed, but instead it succeeds in making our eyes continue to be alert because the story would be a shame if we missed it.‚Ä¶ more"

The symbolism that I think tells the most about the trauma experienced by May is color. The color palette of May's room, the colors of the clothes that May wears, even the food that May eats every day. The colors are dull and grey. Colors contributed to the formation of past trauma. The presence of magicians as a medium for May's trauma healing does not seem to be without reason. Magic performed by the magician."

This film invites empathy and stimulates the audience to interpret the film more deeply.

Through this amazing spiritual journey, many moments are presented that convey various very valuable messages, in the form of tolerance, unity, peace, mutual understanding, etc. The chemistry between father and son in this film is very touching. Basically, this is one of Indonesia's religious films best ever."

Apart from its religious elements, this film really depicts an extraordinary relationship between father and son, and can really connect with the audience. Apart from that, there are many meaningful life lessons that you can learn whatever your beliefs, because the basis is how to be a good human being, not being a good people.

Contains criticism but delivered in a balanced and down-to-earth manner. Because just the matter of \"the God you worship is different from me\" has already created a crisis of tolerance in this country. Many militant mass organizations under the banner of religion were formed, which in the end only made things worse. Feeling most righteous. Scorning anyone who doesn't share their beliefs. Until we forget that Indonesian society can be harmonious on the basis of pluralism. Belief in the Almighty God, if practiced well and with tolerance, will shape human life in a just and civilized manner and make it easier for us to achieve the country's main goal, namely Indonesian unity."

This film conveys a narrative of a spiritual journey related to tolerance which I feel is very close to the current situation. A journey about how we can appreciate and not just advise. And what is unique about the depiction of these two figures can be said to be a depiction of hablum minallah and hablum minannas, where Mr. Mahmud's character can be said to be closely related to the concept of hablum minallah, but he forgot about the hablum minannas, Likewise with the Heli figure who is close to the Hablum Minannas but not to the Hablum Minallah."

The secret is precisely because \"Searching for the Hilal\" does not try to be a medium for preaching. Ismail Basbeth shows that religion is still not free from possibilities, rather than just being a tool of judgment. Religion, whose basic function is black-and-white and good-bad guidelines, turns out to not be that practical as a guide to living life. There are many moral questions that are not answered until the end of this film, because an answer sheet is not provided. It is very clear that if Ismail Basbeth deliberately only presents illustrations, we ourselves are free to determine our preferences. After all, who knows how wise the person who can answer the questions in this film correctly is."

That memory is the highest happy place in my life, because I still remember the friends who sat next to me, because I still know exactly how I felt at that time. hopefully you will never forget. and I hope my friends are healthy, their families are also healthy, even though they haven't heard from me for a long time. Sherinaaaaaaa...... you crush me from my baby!!!!!!!!!"

Warm, simple, and the antagonist characters are still the blueprint for bad characters in children's and family films. The astronomer who appeared, Mr. Irfan, still works at Bosscha. Every Saturday evening there is a live broadcast of night sky observations on the Bosscha Observatory YouTube channel. Who knows, we might see Canopus, Capella, Vega."

Yes, but the battles are also torn between being brutal or funny like Jackie Chan. The antagonists after decades are still the same, too black and white. Even if it's as simple as it seems, if it's made too complicated and complicated with mystery it will make the audience lazy to think. Actually, there's no need to make a sequel.

Very well crafted. Written with care and definitely researched. All the reasons for cause and effect are clear. And most importantly, it's close to our lives. After it's written so well, then how do the creators visualize it? Beautiful and right on target, not too much. Marsha‚Ä¶ more"

In the third act of their conflict, there is a scene of Gilang running next to Ambar's car, and again a symmetrical image is presented. Both are indications of the idea that domestic conflict in this film can be presented neatly, well-designed and measurable. And pleasing to the eye for the audience. Neatness is not only in symmetrical images, but also in the choice... more"

The dialogue is clever and the visuals are punchy with metaphors. The splash of issues from the third person does not make the narrative and characterization shallow. Timothy plays beautifully and perhaps this is one of Antara's best performances. Sabrina not only succeeded in making the remake of this soap opera charming but also set high standards for the quality of our local dramas."

The script, the breath of this film, is woven so beautifully. all the characters are built nicely. The storyline runs neatly and realistically. I feel like I want to say goodbye to Ms. Tinut and Ms. Sabrina. This good script wouldn't be optimal if it wasn't supported by the performances of the actors. From the start, I expected that Marsha Timothy would give a total performance and it turned out to be true.‚Ä¶ more"

As someone who has been in a relationship as tiring as that, I really relate to Ambar or Gilang's position. But as children, we also understand what Bagas feels. It's tiring to be a child who is \"forced\" to understand the feelings of his parents. By the way, this is indeed one of the best Indonesian drama (wedding) films, mah."

It is also only towards the end that we truly see some meditations on what it means to be a resident of Jakarta, especially for reverse-diaspora. The paradoxical desire to live‚Ä¶ more"

Even though they are not related to each other, this film quite clearly depicts different issues but is still one life. What surprised me was that some of the scenes were so frontal."
